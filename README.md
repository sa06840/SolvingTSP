# A Comparative Analysis of Genetic Algorithms, ACO, Q-Learning, and SARSA for Solving TSP

My team member and I compared the effectiveness of four AI-based algorithms—Genetic Algorithms, Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), Q-Learning, and SARSA—in solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). This project involved analyzing the performance of each algorithm on multiple TSP datasets and evaluating their efficiency through metrics like computation time and solution quality. The project deepened my knowledge of optimization algorithms and their practical applications in solving NP-hard problems.
