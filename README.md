# A Comparative Analysis of Genetic Algorithms, ACO, Q-Learning, and SARSA for Solving TSP

Overview: My team member and I compared the effectiveness of four AI-based algorithms—Genetic Algorithms, Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), Q-Learning, and SARSA—in solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). This project involved analyzing the performance of each algorithm on multiple TSP datasets and evaluating their efficiency through metrics like computation time and solution quality. This project deepened my knowledge of optimization algorithms and their practical applications in solving NP-hard problems.

Aim: Compare AI algorithms for solving an NP-hard problem such as the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)

Action: My role involved understanding the theory behind Genetic Algorithms and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), developing these algorithms, and fine-tuning their hyperparameters for the TSP dataset. Compared the best models with Q-learning and SARSA, focusing on the time taken and the optimal value achieved for TSP

Outcomes: ACO achieved the best optimal solution (10,755), followed by SARSA (12,055). Genetic Algorithm (14,767) converged late, while Q-Learning (20,060) was the least optimal but faster. The true optimal is 9,352
